2. WHEN saving analyses THEN the system SHALL store metadata including subreddits, date ranges, and summary statistics
3. WHEN viewing history THEN the system SHALL display a list of saved analyses with key information
4. WHEN selecting a saved analysis THEN the system SHALL load the complete results with all visualizations
5. WHEN managing history THEN the system SHALL allow users to delete unwanted analyses
6. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL maintain a maximum of 100 saved analyses to prevent storage bloat

### Requirement 7: Data Export and Sharing
