# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a comprehensive test suite for the Reddit Sentiment Analyzer application. The test suite will ensure all major functionality works correctly, including UI interactions, API endpoints, data processing, analysis workflows, and error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Endpoint Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API endpoint tests so that I can ensure all server functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status with health information
2. WHEN the settings endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return current API key status and configuration
3. WHEN the analyze endpoint is called with valid data THEN the system SHALL process Reddit data and return sentiment analysis
4. WHEN the analyze endpoint is called with invalid data THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. WHEN the save analysis endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL store analysis data and return success confirmation
6. WHEN the load analysis endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL retrieve stored analysis data
7. WHEN the reanalyze endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL regenerate analysis with current AI model
8. WHEN the cancel analysis endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL abort ongoing analysis operations

### Requirement 2: Frontend Component Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want frontend component tests so that I can ensure UI elements render and behave correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the App component loads THEN the system SHALL render the main navigation and welcome screen
2. WHEN the AnalysisForm component is displayed THEN the system SHALL show input fields for subreddits, dates, and post limits
3. WHEN the Results component receives data THEN the system SHALL display charts, metrics, and analysis tabs
4. WHEN the Settings component is opened THEN the system SHALL show API key configuration options
5. WHEN the History component is accessed THEN the system SHALL display saved analyses list
6. WHEN form validation occurs THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages for invalid inputs
7. WHEN buttons are clicked THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate actions and state changes

### Requirement 3: Data Processing and Analysis Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want data processing tests so that I can ensure sentiment analysis and data transformation work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Reddit data is processed THEN the system SHALL clean and format text content appropriately
2. WHEN sentiment analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL return scores between -1 and 1 with confidence levels
3. WHEN data aggregation occurs THEN the system SHALL calculate correct averages and distributions
4. WHEN timeline analysis is generated THEN the system SHALL group data by dates with proper statistics
5. WHEN subreddit comparison is performed THEN the system SHALL provide accurate comparative metrics
6. WHEN themes and emotions are extracted THEN the system SHALL identify relevant keywords and patterns

### Requirement 4: Integration and Workflow Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests so that I can ensure the complete analysis workflow functions end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a complete analysis is started THEN the system SHALL fetch Reddit data, analyze sentiment, and return results
2. WHEN progress tracking is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates during analysis
3. WHEN analysis is cancelled THEN the system SHALL stop processing and clean up resources
4. WHEN data is saved and loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity throughout the process
5. WHEN reanalysis is performed THEN the system SHALL use current settings and return updated results
6. WHEN export functionality is used THEN the system SHALL generate correct JSON and CSV files

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Edge Cases Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error handling tests so that I can ensure the system gracefully handles failures and edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts and connection errors gracefully
3. WHEN invalid Reddit data is received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize input appropriately
4. WHEN AI API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback responses and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle file system errors without crashing
6. WHEN malformed data is processed THEN the system SHALL validate structure and provide meaningful errors

### Requirement 6: Performance and Load Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests so that I can ensure the system handles various load conditions appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within reasonable time limits
2. WHEN multiple concurrent requests occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without degradation
3. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL not exceed reasonable memory limits
4. WHEN long-running operations execute THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback and cancellation options
5. WHEN rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate backoff strategies

### Requirement 7: Security and Validation Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want security tests so that I can ensure the system properly validates inputs and protects sensitive data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are handled THEN the system SHALL not expose them in logs or client-side code
2. WHEN user inputs are processed THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all data
3. WHEN file operations occur THEN the system SHALL prevent path traversal and unauthorized access
4. WHEN CORS requests are made THEN the system SHALL enforce appropriate origin restrictions
5. WHEN error messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL not leak sensitive information
